# Python-Instacart-Project

Instacart, an online grocery store that operates through an app, wants to uncover more information about its sales patterns. They would like an exploratory analysis of some of their data to derive insights and form strategies for better customer segmentation. The Instacart stakeholders are most interested in the variety of customers in their database and their purchasing behaviors so that Instacart can launch a targeted marketing strategy.

## Key Questions

    Is there a connection between age and family status in terms of ordering habits?
